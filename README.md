Running "run_analysis.R"

The data for the project can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 

Extract the data into a folder called "data" which should be placed in the folder containing the run_analysis.R script, most simply the working directory. 

When run, the run_analysis.R will use the write.table() command to produce a file, averageData.txt, with the averages of the variables from the initial data which correspond to mean and standard deviation measurements. For more information, see CodeBook.md.
